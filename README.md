# SmartPillDispenser

##Project Idea
As many people, since they get engaged in work or have a forgetting mindset, they tend to skip
their medicine unknowingly and also some tend to take extra medications knowingly or
unknowingly, which sometimes can lead to serious issues in their health conditions. Therefore to
help one get reminded of their medication this smart pill dispenser comes handy. This pill
dispenser dispenses pill at the time set by the user everyday along with water in a glass. It is also
portable and small.

##Abstract
The dispenser will have two major parts - Medication holder and Water storage. The medication
holder will be in shape of a wheel and contains 12 sections for the fill to last. Each time when the
RTC module reaches the time set by the user, the wheel like container rotates using a motor and
dispenses a pill stored in it which will then prompt the user by flashing of LEDs and buzzer. The
container can be refilled using push buttons which is used to move the wheel. Next comes the
water storage which will store 360 ml of water (30 ml for each take) and is dispensed along with
tablet in a glass placed aside. Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect whether the medication is taken
or not using the presence of the tablet cup and water glass and is counted.

##Hardware Requirements
• Arduino UNO
• LEDs
• Push Buttons
• RTC module
• Stepper Motor
• Servo Motors
• Jumper wires
• Battery
• Buzzer
• Motor Driver
• LCD
• Ultrasonic sensor

##Software Used
1) Fusion 360 is used to design the medication and water storage containers
2) Arduino IDE is used for major coding instructions
with the coding part. Also I’ll be learning about using of RTC module. More on Fusion 360
designing and assembling. Use of automated technology into day-to-day things.
